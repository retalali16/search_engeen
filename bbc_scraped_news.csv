https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cwyvx9zeq04o,"Russia has held its annual Victory Day parade marking the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. Vladimir Putin was joined by China's Xi Jinping for the commemorations, with Russia saying 27 world leaders were attending the 80th anniversary event. Security had been tightened after days of Ukrainian strikes targeting the capital city. A three-day ceasefire was announced by Russia to coincide with the parade, which Ukraine rejected as a farce. It says Russia has launched thousands of attacks since the truce came into force, Russia denies this and has accused Kyiv of hundreds of violations. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg reports from the Moscow's Red Square. Cardinals joined the newly appointed pope in the Sistine Chapel, in a service that began with a prayer. He becomes the first American to be elected to lead the Catholic Church. The new pope Robert Prevost will be known as Pope Leo XIV - the first American pontiff to be elected leader of the Catholic Church. Robert Prevost becomes the first American to be elected pope, following a two-day conclave in Vatican City. Speaking from the Vatican balcony just after being unveiled as the new pontiff, he paid tribute to his predecessor and called for unity. Black smoke emerges from the chimney in the Vatican, indicating no new pope has been elected yet See the moments previous popes were elected by conclaves past, from 1939 to 2013. After a lengthy wait, black smoke emerged from the Sistine Chapel's chimney at around 9pm local time. The signal means more voting will take place tomorrow as a new pope has not yet been chosen. 'World Cup can be incentive for Russia to end war', says Trump BBC News archive footage tells the extraordinary story of the smoke signal confusion of the 1958 Conclave. After a week of good weather, Paris was hit by a hailstorm and thunder on Saturday afternoon. The man expected to be Germany's next foreign minister reacts after Friedrich Merz fell short in a parliamentary vote to be named chancellor. Residents applauded as the lights came back on in Spain's capital, after a huge power cut brought the country to a standstill. From traffic lights turning off in Spain, to Metro stations plunged into darkness in Portugal - power outages have caused havoc. The BBC's religion editor Aleem Maqbool explains why it's so difficult to guess who will be the next pontiff. Hundreds of thousands of mourners gather in Rome to pay tribute to the late pontiff. The Pope has chosen to be buried in a simple coffin at the church of Santa Maria Maggiore. The Pope is being laid to rest at the church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyglw20lg2o,"Catholicism has rarely been more prominent in US politics as the Trump administration openly embraces advisers and officials who proudly say faith has shaped their politics. But any jubilation on the American Make America Great Again right about the new Pope this week quickly dissipated as key voices from Donald Trump's Maga movement came to a disappointed conclusion: the first American Pope does not appear to be ""America first"". Little is known about the political leanings of Pope Leo XIV, born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago. He has voiced concerns for the poor and immigrants, chosen a name that may reference more liberal church leadership, and he appears to have both supported the liberal-leaning Pope Francis and criticised the US president's policies on social media. But the president so far has said only that Leo's election was a ""great honour"" for the US. Still, some of Trump's most prominent supporters were quick to attack Pope Leo, lambasting him as a possible challenge to Trump and on the perception that he will follow Pope Francis in areas like immigration. ""I mean it's kind of jaw-dropping,"" Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon told the BBC on Friday, speaking of Leo's election. ""It is shocking to me that a guy could be selected to be the Pope that had had the Twitter feed and the statements he's had against American senior politicians,"" said Bannon, a hard-right Trump loyalist, practising Catholic and former altar boy. And he predicted that there's ""definitely going to be friction"" between Leo and Trump. The Pope's brother, John Prevost, told The New York Times that he thinks his brother would voice his disagreements with the president. ""I know he's not happy with what's going on with immigration,"" he said. ""I know that for a fact. How far he'll go with it is only one's guess, but he won't just sit back. I don't think he'll be the silent one."" Recent survey data shows that about 20% of Americans identify as Catholic, according to the non-partisan Pew Research Center. About 53% identify with or lean towards the Republican Party, though there's plenty of nuance, too: America's two Catholic presidents, John F Kennedy and Joe Biden, were both Democrats. And nearly two-thirds of US Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances - a departure from the Church's current stance. US Catholics also broadly supported Pope Francis: 78% of those surveyed in February viewed him favorably, including a majority of Catholic Republicans. A number of Catholics in the new Pope's home city of Chicago on Thursday aired disappointment with President Trump and said they hoped Pope Leo XIV would follow the path of his predecessor. ""We hope he'll continue with Francis's agenda going forward,"" said Rick Stevens, a Catholic deacon from New Jersey who happened to be visiting Chicago when he heard the news. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops, which leads and coordinates US Catholic activities, celebrated Pope Leo's election and the message it sends. ""Certainly, we rejoice that a son of this nation has been chosen by the cardinals, but we recognise that he now belongs to all Catholics and to all people of good will,"" the conference said in a statement. ""His words advocating peace, unity, and missionary activity already indicate a path forward."" Though Maga supporters represent a small subset of US Catholics, it's one with outsized access to conservative media and Trump's ear. On Bannon's War Room podcast - known for its hard-right, pro-Trump bent - one guest after another heaped criticism on the new Pope. ""This guy has been massively embraced by the liberals and the progressives,"" said Ben Harnwell, a journalist who led Bannon's efforts to establish what he calls a ""gladiator school"" for the ""Judeo-Christian West"" outside of Rome. ""He is one of their own… he has [Pope] Francis's DNA in him,"" Harnwell said. Jack Posobiec, another Maga commentator dialing in from Rome, was blunt: ""This choice of the American cardinal was done as a response, as a message to President Trump."" The full picture of what led to Pope Leo's selection on Thursday is still emerging and church decisions don't map neatly onto US politics. Still, watchers around the world have pored over Pope Leo's social media profiles in search of clues about his leanings and beliefs. An X account under his name, with tweets going as far back as 2015, shares links to criticism of Trump's approach to immigration and hints at other political views, such as stricter gun control. In February, the account sharply rebuked the US vice-president by posting a link to an opinion piece titled ""JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others"". The account also posted a link to a letter from Pope Francis after he clashed with Vance over church doctrine and immigration. Vance – a Catholic convert – had given an interview in defence of the Trump administration's immigration policies. Vance has routinely invoked his faith in defense of the administration, particularly immigration policies, which the White House has said put ""America first"". ""There is a Christian concept that you love your family and then you love your neighbour, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens, and then after that, prioritise the rest of the world. A lot of the far left has completely inverted that,"" Vance told Fox News. But US Democrats were not spared either on the account, which has more than a decade of posts. They appear to support Catholic employers who refuse to pay for contraceptives via employee health plans, and following the 2016 US presidential election, one post links to an article accusing Democrat Hillary Clinton of ignoring pro-life Catholic voters. The BBC asked the Vatican to confirm the account was Leo's, but did not receive a response. Vice-President Vance told conservative broadcaster Hugh Hewitt on Friday: ""I try not to play the politicisation of the Pope game. ""I'm sure he's going to say a lot of things that I love. I'm sure he'll say some things that I disagree with, but I'll continue to pray for him and the Church despite it all and through it all, and that'll be the way that I handle it."" The new Pope's LGBTQ views are also unclear, but some groups, including the conservative College of Cardinals, believe he may be less supportive than Pope Francis. Matt Walsh, a commentator with the conservative Daily Wire, wrote: ""There are some good signs and bad signs with this new Pope. I want to see what he actually does with his papacy before I pass any kind of judgment."" But some of the most dedicated Maga supporters already have made up their minds. Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer who has Trump's ear, swaying the president on top personnel decisions, called the new Pope ""anti-Trump, anti-Maga, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis"". Bannon, who had suggested Leo as a dark horse for the papacy, predicted tensions between the White House and Vatican - and said they could even tear apart American Catholics. ""Remember, President Trump was not shy about taking a shot at Pope Francis,"" he said. ""So if this Pope - which he will do - tries to come between President Trump and his implementation of the mass deportation programme, I would stand by.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6293qgd46zo,"A massive increase in the price of water is just one consequence of a week of aerial attacks on the Red Sea city of Port Sudan. Once seen as a relatively safe haven from Sudan's devastating civil war, Port Sudan is now reeling from days of bombardment from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group. After six days of drone attacks, smoke is still rising from three fuel depots which were targeted. Rescue teams are gathered around the destroyed sites, but they are struggling to put the fires out. The conflict, which began as a struggle between the leaders of the RSF and the army more than two years ago, has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises and forced more than 12 million people from their homes. One of those who fled to Port Sudan is 26-year-old Mutasim, who did not want his second name published for safety reasons. The BBC spoke to him after he had waited hours for a water vendor to turn up. The vital commodity has become scarce. The explosions at the fuel depots have left Port Sudan without the diesel used to power the pumps that bring up the groundwater. Mutasim told the BBC that whereas a day's supply of water cost him 2,000 Sudanese pounds ($3.30; £2.50) a week ago, he is now being charged five times that amount. It leaves him and the seven other members of his family without much water for cooking, cleaning and bathing. ""Soon, we won't be able to afford it,"" he said explaining that he gets money from buying and selling basic goods in the market. Water is not the only challenge in Port Sudan. Daily life is going back to normal, markets and shops are open, but there are crowds of cars outside the city's petrol stations as people desperately wait for fuel. ""It could take me five hours to get petrol,"" said Mutasim. It is a situation that many Sudanese have faced before, but not in this city. Until last week, Port Sudan was one of the few places in the country that was considered protected from the worst of the civil war. ""We came here two years ago from Omdurman,"" Mutasim said, referring to the city that sits on the other side of the River Nile from the capital, Khartoum. It cost the family their entire savings - $3,000 (£2,250) – to set up in a new place. ""We were forced to leave our home by the RSF, so it was a relief to come here. Life was starting to go back to normal."" ""We were thinking about moving because it is no longer safe here, but it's so expensive - and where do we go?"" Port Sudan has been experiencing blackouts for the past two weeks, which have been made worse by the latest attacks. ""My auntie is over 70 years old, she is struggling with the heat and humidity because there is no electricity for fans at night,"" Mutasim said. ""We can't sleep."" Hawa Mustafa, a teacher from el-Geneina in Darfur, in the west of the country, also sought refuge in Port Sudan. She has been living with her four children in a shelter for displaced people for over two years. She said this week's attacks left her ""living in fear"". ""The drones came to us and we returned to a state of war and the lack of safety,"" she told the BBC. ""The sounds of the drones and the anti-aircraft missiles remind me of the first days of the war in el-Geneina."" Hawa lives without her husband, who has been unable to leave their home due to the deteriorating security situation. She is now responsible for her family. ""I don't know where to go if things get worse in Port Sudan. I was planning to go to one of the neighbouring countries, but it seems that this dream will no longer come true."" Another person living in the city, Mariam Atta, told the BBC that ""life has changed completely"". ""We are struggling to cope,"" she said. ""The fear is constant."" Since Sudan's civil war started in 2023, humanitarian agencies have depended on Port Sudan as a gateway to bring in aid, because of its port and the country's only functional international airport. It has been used by organisations such as the UN's World Food Programme to deliver food assistance. ""Port Sudan is our main humanitarian hub,"" says Leni Kinzli, WFP spokesperson for Sudan. ""In March, we had almost 20,000 metric tonnes of food distributed, and I would say definitely more than half of that came through Port Sudan,"" she told the BBC. The WFP has said that there is currently famine in 10 regions of the country, with 17 more at risk. Many aid agencies are now concerned these attacks could block the flow of aid, making the humanitarian situation even worse. ""I think this is going to severely constrain the delivery of life-saving food and medical supplies, which will risk further deterioration of the already critical situation,"" Shashwat Saraf, country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the BBC. He added that while agencies will look for other routes into the country, it will be challenging. At night the city is quiet. Before the attacks, people would gather at the coast and some would watch football in local cafes. But the electricity blackout has left the city in the dark and residents are choosing to stay at home for security reasons. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jnl79mejo,"US President Donald Trump has appointed Fox News host and former New York prosecutor Jeanine Pirro as interim US attorney for Washington DC. The announcement comes after Trump withdrew his first pick for the job after he lost key Republican support in the Senate, which votes on such positions. After Trump's 2020 loss to Joe Biden, Pirro made false statements about the election that were part of a lawsuit against Fox News by a company that makes voting machines. The case was settled for more than $787m (£594m). Trump called Pirro ""a powerful crusader for victims of crime"" in a social media post announcing his selection. Meanwhile, critics described her as unqualified. The president did not indicate whether Pirro, 73, would serve in the job permanently, which requires Senate confirmation, or how long her term would last. In the Truth Social post on Thursday night, Trump noted that she previously served as a Republican district attorney in Westchester, New York, as well as a judge. He also touted her roles on various shows on Fox News, including on The Five, which he called ""one of the Highest Rated Shows on Television"". Pirro has been a close ally of Trump for decades. In one of his last actions during his first term, he issued a pardon to her husband, who had been convicted of tax evasion decades earlier. Democrats were quick to criticise the appointment of Pirro, the second Fox News host with to receive a high-profile federal job after Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, raising questions about her credentials for the role and about her career outside of broadcasting. ""Which Fox News host will get the next federal appointment,"" Jimmy Gomez, a Democrat representative from California, wrote on X. The Democratic National Committee wrote in a statement: ""Jeanine Pirro is yet another unqualified TV personality with a history of putting Trump and violent insurrectionists above the rule of law."" Republicans, like South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, celebrated the news on social media. He called Pirro a ""grand slam, home run"" choice. ""She is exactly the right person at the right time to take on this responsibility,"" Graham said on X. Pirro replaces current interim US attorney Ed Martin, a former conservative podcaster who Trump appointed this January. He was let go after North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis, a key swing vote, said he would refuse to confirm Martin for the role on a permanent basis, citing ""friction"" over how Martin viewed those involved in the 6 January 2021 riots at the US Capitol. Tillis told reporters this week that he had ""no tolerance for anybody who entered the building on January 6"". Martin has been a staunch critic of the investigation into the Capitol riots. While serving in the role on an interim basis, he fired prosecutors who oversaw prosecutions of alleged and convicted rioters. Trump said Martin will remain at the US Justice Department and serve as director of the ""weaponization working group"", which looks into officials who investigated Trump, the president said in another post on social media. Since taking office, Trump has issued pardons and ended prosecutions against 6 January rioters who stormed the US Capitol in an effort to block Biden's election win over Trump in the 2020 election.

In a series of tweets, he says leaders from France, Germany, Poland and the UK stand together in Kyiv to show their support for Ukraine. “The bloodshed must end,” he says. We can bring you some of the latest images from Kyiv. As a reminder, a meeting of European leaders is currently under way as they try to secure a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war.

Chief political correspondent, travelling with the PM Keir Starmer and his fellow European leaders are here in Kyiv now, in large part as a response to the parade President Putin held in Moscow yesterday where he was joined by around 20 world leaders including Xi Jinping of China. Within an hour of stepping off the sleeper train, Keir Starmer joined President Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk and President Zelensky, with the First Lady Olena Zelenska, at Maidan square in central Kyiv - long a symbol of Ukrainian independence. At a solemn ceremony, they laid candles at a memorial to Ukraine’s war dead. What’s clear from speaking to senior UK government sources is that VE Day is weighing heavily on their minds too. At the end of a week in which Britain commemorated 80 years since the end of war in Europe, Starmer is here in Ukraine to see a war in Europe. Vitaliy Shevchenko
Russia editor, BBC Monitoring As the Victory Day ceasefire declared by Vladimir Putin enters its third and final day, more Russian attacks are reported in Ukraine. In northern Sumy region, an 85-year-old woman was killed, three others were injured, 19 residential homes and 10 other buildings were destroyed or damaged, Ukrainian police say. In Kostyantynivka, eastern Donetsk region, one person was injured and two apartment blocks caught fire after Russian attacks. Rescuers who arrived at the scene were targeted by repeat “double tap” strikes, Ukrainian state emergencies service DSNS says. In the southern city of Kherson, a 58-year-old local resident sought medical help after being attacked by a Russian drone carrying explosives, the regional administration says. The meeting of European leaders in Kyiv today comes after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced new sanctions on Putin’s so-called “shadow fleet” yesterday. This term refers to a group of Russian oil tankers used to get around current sanctions on oil and gas exports. In response, Zelensky said in a tweet on Friday that he is grateful to the UK for the “powerful new sanctions package”. “Every step that limits the Kremlin’s ability to fund its war brings peace closer. The UK is once again demonstrating a leadership approach,” he said. Here's a photo of the leaders meeting at the Mariyinsky Palace, the official residence of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They are expected to speak to the press later, and we'll bring you the key developments as soon as that happens. Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov says Ukraine’s allies must stop sending weapons to Ukraine before any ceasefire can happen. Speaking to ABC News
, external
, Peskov says if arms deliveries continue, it will be an “advantage” for Ukraine, as the country “will continue their total mobilisation” and bring more troops to the front line. He also says Ukraine is ""not ready for immediate negotiations,"" while Putin is trying to “achieve a settlement through peaceful and diplomatic means"". Donald Tusk, Keir Starmer, Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska, Volodymyr Zelensky, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Mertz gather at Kyiv's Independence Square We're now seeing images of leaders from the UK, France, Germany and Poland alongside Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky. They've been paying their respects to victims of the war at a memorial in Kyiv's Independence Square. In a joint statement, the leaders say they are ""ready to support peace talks"" Three things we learned from Putin's Red Square parade While Ukraine’s European allies meet in Kyiv, Russia has this week been hosting leaders from around the world for the country's Victory Day commemorations. Russia said that 27 world leaders attended yesterday’s parade in Red Square, but it was the presence of China’s Xi Jinping that stood really stood out. Russian state TV spoke of relations between the two countries as being at their highest-ever level, united against the ""collective West"". Putin and Xi held two rounds of talks before the parade as well as an informal chat on the war in Ukraine, Chinese reports said. Brazil's Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Serbian President Aleksander Vucic were also at the event. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico was the only leader of an EU member country to travel to Moscow. ""My first thought is with the Ukrainians,"" says Emmanuel Macron as he arrives in Kyiv. In a post on X, the French president praises Ukrainians for fighting not just for their country, but for Europe too. He says: “Faced with Russian aggression, our response must be collective."" Which is why he is making this trip with Germany, Poland and the UK. He also shares three key messages: ""First, peace,"" he says, ""a just and lasting peace begins with a complete and unconditional ceasefire"". Second, ""the peace agreement to be built must guarantee its security"". ""Finally, the future,"" Macron adds, ""a fee, strong, prosperous, and European Ukraine: that is our vision."" “History is watching us,” he concludes.

Security correspondent In Ukraine's Donetsk region, the war continues Today is the last day of Russia’s self-declared three-day ceasefire which is due to end at midnight tonight, Moscow time. The US embassy here in Kyiv is warning of the risk of significant air strikes in the days ahead. But while there has been a pause in the near nightly bombardment of Ukrainian cities by Russian drones and missiles, there has been no let-up in fighting on the front line. Britain, France, Germany and Poland are all urging Russia to agree to the US proposal of a 30-day ceasefire. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov has said Russia first needs Western nations to stop arming Ukraine, something that would leave this embattled nation vulnerable to further Russian advances on its towns and villages. The war continues. In a joint statement released before their arrival, Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Mertz and Donald Tusk said they will ""stand in Kyiv in solidarity with Ukraine"". The statement adds that they will be calling for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire, first proposed by the US in March, which they say will enable talks to take place for a lasting peace. ""We are ready to support peace talks as soon as possible, to discuss technical implementation of the ceasefire, and prepare for a full peace deal,"" the leaders say, adding they will ""ratchet up pressure"" on Russia until it agrees to an enduring ceasefire. Later in the day, they are scheduled to host a virtual meeting with other leaders. They will provide an update on progress towards what is being called an ""international reassurance force"", that Number 10 says could ""regenerate"" Ukraine's armed forces after a possible peace deal.

BBC News British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has just arrived in Kyiv, along with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. The three leaders arrived by train from Poland after meeting with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Tusk is expected to join them in Kyiv later today. The leaders are using the visit to urge Russia to ""agree a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire"" – a proposal initially made by US President Donald Trump. We've seen an image of the world leaders, who gathered in Rzeszów, Poland, before making their trip to Kyiv. In a post on X, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk shares an insight into his meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron. Today's meeting of Ukraine’s allies is not the only high-profile gathering that has taken place this week. Yesterday, Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted 20 international leaders, including China's Xi Jinping, for Victory Day celebrations in Moscow - an event to commemorate the end of World War Two. Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with Nato allies in Norway, where he reiterated the UK's support for Ukraine. ""The message of leaders here is very, very clear, and that is that we're focused on Ukraine,"" he said. ""And so that's where our absolute focus is - with Ukraine, defending the values that yesterday at VE Day we were remembering and commemorating, that were hard-won in the Second World War.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qgz18glljo,"Donald Trump's administration is ""actively looking at"" suspending habeas corpus - the right of a person to challenge their detention in court - one of the US president's top aides has said. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, told reporters on Friday that the US Constitution allowed for the legal liberty to be suspended in times of ""rebellion or invasion"". His comments come as judges have sought to challenge some recent detentions made by the Trump administration in an effort to combat illegal immigration, as well as remove dissenting foreign students. ""A lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not,"" Miller said. There are several pending civil cases against the Trump administration's deportation of undocumented migrants based on habeaus corpus. Most recently, a federal judge ordered the release of a Turkish university student who had been detained for six weeks after writing an article that was critical of Israel. Last week, another judge ordered a Columbia University student detained over his advocacy for Palestinians be released after a petition on habeas corpus grounds. However, other judges have sided with the Trump administration in such disputes. Miller described habeas corpus as a ""privilege"", and said Congress had already passed a law stripping judicial courts of jurisdiction over immigration cases. Legal experts have questioned the veracity of his interpretation of US law. One of Trump's key campaign pledges was to deport millions of immigrants from the US, and his administration has pursued different means of expediting deportations since returning to the White House. In March, a federal judge's order prevented the Trump administration from invoking a centuries-old wartime law to justify deporting more than 200 Venezuelans, despite the flights going ahead. But deportations have lagged behind detentions - while one person has been deported erroneously. CNN reported, citing unnamed sources, that Trump was personally involved in the discussions around suspending habeas corpus. Trump himself has not mentioned the suspension of habeas corpus, but has said he would take steps to combat injunctions against his actions on deportation. ""There are ways to mitigate it and there's some very strong ways,"" he said in April. ""There's one way that's been used by three very highly respected presidents, but we hope we don't have to go that route."" Habeas corpus - which literally means ""you should have the body"" - allows for a person to be brought before a judge so the legality of their detention can be decided by a judge. The legal right has been suspended four times in US history: during the American Civil War under Abraham Lincoln, in Hawaii following the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour, in the Philippines during US ownership in 1905, and while combat the activities of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan group in the 19th Century. It is unclear if Trump will attempt to suspend habeaus corpus without the approval of Congress.

The accident happened on Friday while the diver was underwater in Porticello, police said, adding the precise cause of death was still unknown. According to local Italian media, the diver was a 39-year-old Dutch national who worked for a specialist salvage company. It comes as salvage ships arrived earlier this month to waters off the small port of Porticello, near Palermo, where the Bayesian vessel sank during freak weather last August. Seven of the 22 people onboard the Bayesian last summer were killed, including Mr Lynch, 59, and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah. Morgan Stanley International bank chairman Jonathan Bloomer, 70, and his wife, Judy, 71, US lawyer Chris Morvillo, his wife Neda Morvillo and the yacht's chef Recaldo Thomas, who was originally from Antigua, also died in the sinking on 19 August. Fifteen people managed to escape on a lifeboat including a one-year-old and Mr Lynch's wife Angela Bacares. The cause of the sinking is still under investigation with naval experts saying a yacht of Bayesian's calibre should have been able to withstand the storm and certainly should not have sunk as rapidly as it did. The salvage operation is being overseen by British marine consultancy TMC Marine and led by Dutch-based companies Hebo, a maritime services company from Rotterdam, and SMIT Salvage, with support from Italian specialists. About 70 specialist personnel have been deployed to Sicily from across Europe to work on the recovery operation. On Thursday, the team said on-site preparations were on schedule and ""significant progress"" had been made over the past five days. Analysis of the yacht and the surrounding seabed confirmed there had been no change to its condition since the last inspection, meaning plans to raise the vessel can now go ahead. Work to move the Bayesian into an upright position and lift it to the surface was scheduled to begin later this month - subject to suitable weather and sea conditions. Before the vessel is transported to port, sea water will be pumped out of it. Before the Bayesian is raised it will be held in position by steel slings, as salvage workers detach the vessel's extensive rigging and 72m (236ft) mast, thought to be one of the tallest in the world. These will then be stored on the seabed and recovered after the team has recovered the ship's hull, which investigators say is a primary source of evidence. There has not been any pollution from the yacht reported, with conditions being monitored and efforts made to secure its tank vents and openings. Inquest proceedings in the UK are looking at the deaths of Mr Lynch and his daughter, and Mr and Mrs Bloomer, who were all British nationals. Mr Lynch and his daughter were said to have lived in the vicinity of London, and the Bloomers lived in Sevenoaks in Kent. The tycoon founded software giant Autonomy in 1996 and was cleared in June last year of carrying out a massive fraud over the sale of the firm to Hewlett-Packard (HP) in 2011. The boat trip was a celebration of his acquittal in the case in the US. George Laing, 32, says many people are asking him how to hunt for a bargain dream home overseas. All 133 cardinals are voting in the Sistine Chapel to decide who will succeed Pope Francis. The secretive process will get underway at the Vatican to find a new leader of the Catholic Church. Cardinals are set to gather later this week to take part in a highly guarded vote for a new pope.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74qjjvzlgjo,"The US-China trade war could be letting up, with the world's two largest economies set to begin talks in Switzerland. Top trade officials from both sides will meet on Saturday in the first high-level meeting since US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in January. Beijing retaliated immediately and a tense stand-off ensued as the two countries heaped levies on each other. New US tariffs on Chinese imports stand at 145%, and some US exports to China face duties of 125%. There have been weeks of stern, and sometimes fiery, rhetoric where each side sought to paint the other as the more desperate party. And yet this weekend they will face each other over the negotiating table. So why now? Despite multiple rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs, both sides have been sending signals that they want to break the deadlock. Except it wasn't clear who would blink first. ""Neither side wants to appear to be backing down,"" said Stephen Olson, senior visiting fellow at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute and a former US trade negotiator. ""The talks are taking place now because both countries have judged that they can move forward without appearing to have caved in to the other side."" Still, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian emphasised on Wednesday that ""the talks are being held at the request of the US"". And the commerce ministry framed it as a favour to Washington, saying it was answering the ""calls of US businesses and consumers"". The Trump administration, however, claims it's Chinese officials who ""want to do business very much"" because ""their economy is collapsing"". ""They said we initiated? Well, I think they ought to go back and study their files,"" Trump said at the White House on Wednesday. But as the talks drew closer, the president struck a more diplomatic note: ""We can all play games. Who made the first call, who didn't make the - it doesn't matter,"" he told reporters on Thursday. ""It only matters what happens in that room."" The timing is also key for Beijing because it's during Xi's visit to Moscow. He was a guest of honour on Friday at Moscow's Victory Day parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the World War Two victory over Nazi Germany. Xi stood alongside leaders from across the Global South - a reminder to Trump's administration that China not only has other options for trade, but it is also presenting itself as an alternative global leader. This allows Beijing to project strength even as it heads to the negotiating table. Trump insists that the tariffs will make America stronger, and Beijing has vowed to ""fight till the end""- but the fact is the levies are hurting both countries. Factory output in China has taken a hit, according to government data. Manufacturing activity in April dipped to the lowest level since December 2023. And a survey by news outlet Caixin this week showed that services activity has reached a seven-month low. The BBC found that Chinese exporters have been reeling from the steep tariffs, with stock piling up in warehouses, even as they strike a defiant note and look for markets beyond the US. ""I think [China] realises that a deal is better than no deal,"" says Bert Hofman, a professor at the East Asian Institute in National University Singapore. ""So they've taken a pragmatic view and said, 'OK, well we need to get these talks going.'"" And so with the major May Day holiday in China over, officials in Beijing have decided the time is right to talk. On the other side, the uncertainty caused by tariffs led to the US economy contracting for the first time in three years. And industries that have long depended on Chinese-made goods are especially worried. A Los Angeles toy company owner told the BBC that they were ""looking at the total implosion of the supply chain"". Trump himself has acknowledged that US consumers will feel the sting. American children may ""have two dolls instead of 30 dolls"", he said at a cabinet meeting this month, ""and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally"". Trump's approval ratings have also slid over fears of inflation and a possible recession, with more than 60% of Americans saying he was focusing too much on tariffs. ""Both countries are feeling pressure to provide a bit of reassurance to increasingly nervous markets, businesses, and domestic constituencies,"" Mr Olson says. ""A couple of days of meetings in Geneva will serve that purpose."" While the talks have been met with optimism, a deal may take a while to materialise. The talks will mostly be about ""touching base"", Mr Hofman said, adding that this could look like an ""exchange of positions"" and, if things go well, ""an agenda [will be] set for future talks"". The negotiations on the whole are expected to take months, much like what happened during Trump's first term. After nearly two years of tit-for-tat tariffs, the US and China signed a ""phase one"" deal in early 2020 to suspend or reduce some levies. Even then, it did not include thornier issues, such as Chinese government subsidies for key industries or a timeline for scrapping the remaining tariffs. In fact, many of them stayed in place through Joe Biden's presidency, and Trump's latest tariffs add to those older levies. What could emerge this time is a ""phase one deal on steroids"", Mr Olson said: that is, it would go beyond the earlier deal and try to address flashpoints. There are many, from the illegal fentanyl trade which Washington wants China to crack down harder on to Beijing's relationship with Moscow. But all of that is far down the line, experts warn. ""The systemic frictions that bedevil the US-China trade relationship will not be solved any time soon,"" Mr Olson adds. ""Geneva will only produce anodyne statements about 'frank dialogues' and the desire to keep talking."" The White House is ""actively looking at"" suspending the legal right to challenge detention. How consumers are reacting to shipping changes that mean low-value packages entering the US no longer avoid tariffs. Pope Leo XIV has expressed support for immigrants and criticism of JD Vance.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3nd0dwlpgo,"Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk has been released from an immigration detention facility in Louisiana, hours after a federal judge ordered her to be freed. ""Thank you so much. I am a little bit tired, so I will take some time to rest,"" she told reporters and supporters who were crowded outside the facility. US District Judge William Sessions said the student met all the conditions needed for release and lambasted the government's case against her. Ms Otzurk, a doctoral student from Turkey, co-authored an opinion piece in her campus newspaper that was critical of Israel's war. Her arrest follows the White House's crackdown on what it has classified as antisemitism on US campuses. ""Her continued detention chills the speech of millions in this country who are not citizens,"" the judge said on Friday as he ordered her release. Ms Ozturk walked out of the detention facility after six weeks in custody and was greeted by cheers and with her hands on her heart. She had been detained since March, when US immigration officials arrested her on the streets in Massachusetts. Videos of the arrest showed masked plain-clothes officers surrounding her after a Ramadan celebration, handcuffing her and then taking her into an unmarked car. Her detention sparked nationwide protests. The US Department of Homeland Security had accused Ms Ozturk of ""engag[ing] in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organisation that relishes the killing of Americans"". After the judge's ruling, a DHS spokesperson responded: ""Visas provided to foreign students to live and study in the United States are a privilege not a right. ""The Trump administration is committed to restoring the rule of law and common sense to our immigration system, and will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of aliens who have no right to be in this country."" Earlier this week, the judge ordered that Ms Ozturk be transferred by 14 May to immigration authorities in Vermont, where she was last held before she was moved to Louisiana. On Friday, Judge Sessions said that she should be released immediately without travel restrictions, so she can go to Vermont or Massachusetts, where Tufts is located, as needed. He heard from a number of witnesses in the case, including Ms Ozturk, her doctor and a Tufts University professor. The government did not call any witnesses during Friday's hearing. During her testimony, which she offered virtually, Ms Ozturk told the court about her Fulbright scholarship and her PhD work. She said her asthma had worsened during her detention, and at one point she had to take a short break after suffering an asthma attack on camera. Judge Sessions said Ms Ozturk had raised ""very substantial"" claims that her First Amendment right to free speech and her due process rights were violated. He said the only evidence the administration had against Ms Ozturk was her op-ed. ""That literally is the case,"" he said, according to court reporters. ""There is no evidence that she has engaged in violence or advocated violence."" In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is representing Ms Ozturk, said they were ""delighted"" by her release. ""Rümeysa can now return to her beloved Tufts community, resume her studies, and begin teaching again,"" said Noor Zafar, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU. ""Today's ruling underscores a vital First Amendment principle: no one should be imprisoned by the government for expressing their beliefs."" A spokesman for Tufts said the university is ""pleased"" with the judge's ruling, adding: ""We look forward to welcoming her back to campus to resume her doctoral studies"". The Trump administration has detained several international students - some legal residents - who have organised in support of the Palestinians. Last week, a judge ordered the government to release Columbia University student Mohsen Mahdawi after immigration officials detained him during a naturalisation interview. The 34-year-old permanent resident was raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank and had been held at a facility in Vermont. One of the highest profile cases thus far involves Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent pro-Palestinian activist, who remains in a Louisiana detention facility without charges.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd62y5peg8jo,"For Jenny Watt, death is a key part of her life. The 31-year-old spends two or three nights a week chatting to people - whether familiar faces or strangers she's met for the first time - about everything connected with death, from working through grief to the ideal song for a funeral. Jenny runs a handful of death cafés across Glasgow - community spaces that aim to encourage conversation and discussion about a topic few people like to raise. BBC Scotland News attended one of the weekly gatherings, which Jenny believes can help break down taboos about the subject. But what makes a person want to spend time talking about the end of life? Jenny estimates around half the attendees at her groups are there to process grief in some way, whether for a recent loss or from 20 or 30 years ago. ""The same way people are called to nursing or religion, I've always been interested in death,"" she explains. ""It's going to happen to everybody. It might be unique for you and the relationships you are grieving but if you feel it just by yourself it can be a lonely experience. ""When you start talking about it you realise it's not so scary."" Jenny first attended a death café online during the coronavirus pandemic, and notes she wasn't looking to work through any ""traumatic bereavement"" - she was simply interested in the subject. As face-to-face meetings resumed, she could not find any local groups offering discussions about grief around Glasgow. Taking the plunge, she set up her own meeting space around two and-a-half years ago in the Battlefield area of Glasgow, panicking that no-one would turn up. However people did - sometimes just occasionally, others more consistently - to have some tea and a slice of cake while discussing mortality and life. On the night BBC Scotland visited Jenny's café, the attendees were a mix of regulars and first timers, drawn to the meeting for various reasons. As well as those processing grief, Jenny believes another 25% or so would be people diagnosed with a serious condition or caring for someone. The remainder tends to be people simply interested in the topic. ""Whatever people want to talk about, nothing is off limits,"" says Jenny. ""People laugh, they'll cry and at the end I think everyone learns something, whether that's reflecting on their own experience or suddenly realising they should get power of attorney."" That sentiment is shared by Nicola Smith, one of the more regular attendees at the Battlefield meetings. She came along to one of the sessions the same day a close friend of hers had died, and ""the tears flowed"". But letting her emotions pour out is not the only reason that Nicola keeps attending. ""It's such an intrinsic part of our life and living, and yet we don't talk about it,"" she told BBC Scotland. ""We don't know how to deal with it, because we don't do enough talking about it. I lost a very dear relative when my children were very small, and it was the first time my daughter had seen me cry. ""She asked me why my face was wet, and it was the time to explain it was OK to cry and this is what happens when you lose someone you love. It's not a weakness, it's not something you hush up."" Nicola added she believed the topic had become more taboo among modern generations due to the growth of hospice care since the 1960s, meaning a decrease in people dying at home. Those trends could explain the growth in death cafés - the first in the UK was held in 2011 in London, and now there are 3,794 across the UK. In Scotland there are dozens, from Ullapool to Kirkcudbright, but mostly clustered in cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh. Discussion topics bounce around at the meetings, from practical advice on wills and power of attorney to more emotional reflections on personal experiences. They form part of a wider conversation on loss and care, exemplified by May's Demystifying Death week that aims to help people support each other during traumatic experiences. Another visitor in Jenny's group, John Mackay, wrote his PHD about death and the mourning process. He was attending his first death café in Glasgow with the intention of discussing the subject more. ""There's such a taboo about death, but you can take a lighter look at it,"" he says. ""The problem is that people don't talk about it. If you see funerals from other cultures it's very loud and very expressive, but in this country it's very reserved. ""You have to make sure you don't say the wrong thing and that you wear the right clothes - it would be good to loosen it up as well."" Others suggest the greatest benefit of the café is more simple - in that it provides perspective on life. Spencer Mason previously attempted to end his life, but is currently coping with the end-of-life care of a person close to him. ""I think the more we discuss death then surely the more appreciative you become of life,"" he says. ""In circumstances where I've become close to death, I've come out of them wanting life more than ever."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2q937wlqgo,"South Africa has criticised the US as reports emerge suggesting Washington could receive white Afrikaners as refugees as early as next week. A document seen by the BBC's US partner CBS describes the potential resettlement as a ""priority"" for President Donald Trump's government, however the timing has not been publicly confirmed by the White House. In a statement published on Friday, South Africa's foreign ministry described the purported move as ""politically motivated"" and designed to undermine South Africa's ""constitutional democracy"". In February, Trump described Afrikaners as victims of ""racial discrimination"" in an executive order, opening up the prospect for them to resettle in the US. The South African authorities said they would not block the departures of those chosen for resettlement, but said they had sought assurances from the US that those selected had been fully vetted and did not have pending criminal charges. The statement added that allegations of discrimination against the country's white minority were unfounded, and that crime statistics did not indicate that any racial group had been targeted in violent crimes on farms. Some groups representing the rights of white farmers have said they are being deliberately killed because of their race. A spokesperson for the US state department told the BBC they were interviewing individuals interested in resettling in the US and prioritising ""Afrikaners in South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination"". They did not confirm when the resettlement would begin. The Trump administration has also accused South Africa of seizing land from white farmers without compensation, something Pretoria has repeatedly denied. Elon Musk, a top adviser in the Trump administration who grew up in South Africa during apartheid, has been critical of Pretoria, claiming that it is leading a ""genocide"" against white farmers. US officials have planned a press event on Monday at Dulles airport in Virginia to welcome the group, the documents seen by CBS show. According to US media, 54 Afrikaners will arrive as part of the first group. The decision to accept South Africans as refugees comes as the Trump administration has halted nearly all migrant asylum claims. In February, South Africa criticised Trump's executive order opening the US up to the resettlement of white Afrikaners, saying in a statement that ""it is ironic"" the US is open to accepting a group ""that remains amongst the most economically privileged"" while denying vulnerable people from other parts of the world asylum.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8zldv8759o,"Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers were best mates when they illegally felled the much-loved Sycamore Gap tree together. How did they end up turning on each other? It is hard to imagine they were once friends. Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers used to phone each other every day and met up several times a week but, as they stood in the dock at Newcastle Crown Court, waiting for the verdicts to be returned, they looked like complete strangers. The prosecution called them ""the odd couple"" who did everything together. They became friends about four years ago. Carruthers was a mechanic and did Graham ""a good turn"" by fixing his dad's Land Rover, making a special job of it so it could be used for Graham's father's funeral. Graham was a ground worker and he enlisted the man he called his ""best pal"" to help him on jobs, with tasks including the felling of trees for which they split the cash 50/50. Then one night, during Storm Agnes in 2023, the friends went to Sycamore Gap. Under the cover of darkness, they trekked across marshland in winds of up to 60mph and used their experience to mark the trunk, cut a wedge out of it so they knew which direction it would fall and then cut it down with a chainsaw. They filmed it and watched the sycamore crashing to the ground. What they didn't realise is that the phone and vehicle they used would be tracked and the conversations they had would be discovered. As the police questioning began, their stories unravelled and so did their friendship. Graham's phone was used to film the felling. Road and CCTV cameras captured his Range Rover going to and from Steel Rigg, the nearest public car park to the tree. He told the court his car and phone were used by other people, including Adam Carruthers ""who didn't need to ask"". Prosecutor Richard Wright KC was incredulous at his claims, telling jurors: ""According to Graham he didn't go out all night and Carruthers took his car and phone while he slept in blissful ignorance, and his large dog let out not so much as a growl."" It wasn't the only story that was mocked in court. Carruthers' phone had been traced to Northumberland the day the tree was felled. It was suggested to him he was scoping the area out. He told the court he was taking his partner out on a three-hour round trip for a meal at the Metrocentre in Gateshead after she'd recently given birth, but their baby started crying so they turned the car around at a spot that just happened to be near the tree. Christopher Knox, Graham's barrister, said: ""You're telling the jury in spite of the fact she wasn't well enough to lift a baby, you were going 65 miles with [your partner] and a new-born?"" Mr Wright asked Carruthers why they didn't just go for dinner in Carlisle, a short drive from their home. Carruthers agreed there were restaurants in the Cumbrian city but they were ""not the best"". He claimed he was at home all night, fixing the roof of his shed and washing some clothes. Since that night, the court heard the pair had fallen out spectacularly. Carruthers' barrister Andrew Gurney said Graham named his former friend as the culprit because he needed a scapegoat. ""Having found himself in the dock, [Graham's] reached desperately for a lifeline,"" Mr Gurney said, adding: ""He tried to throw Adam Carruthers under the bus to save his own skin."" Graham initially told police he knew who had cut down the tree but would not ""grass"" as the culprit had young children, a not so subtle nod towards his friend. When he felt police were still paying too much attention to him and not enough to Carruthers, he showed officers a picture of his friend holding some owls while standing next to a box of chainsaws. In August 2024, some 11 months after the felling, he made an anonymous call to police to name Carruthers outright. Officers recognised Graham's voice immediately and he was forced to admit to jurors he had indeed made the call. Both men said the friendship ended abruptly one night in the aftermath of the felling and their arrests. Graham drove to Carruthers' home and said they each had to go their own way, and that was that. Mr Knox said his client had been accused of being ""stroppy"" while giving evidence in court, engaging in heated clashes with Mr Wright. ""Does that make him the Sycamore Gap tree murderer?"" he asked the jury , or ""does it mean exactly what he said in his police interviews - he's been dropped in this?"" Jurors clearly thought the former. Emotions were running high right to the very end of the trial when the judge told them both to expect a significant period of time in custody. As Graham was led away from the dock, he had an angry exchange with a member of the public. We still don't know which of the pair cut down the tree and which filmed it. The prosecution said it didn't matter, that they were ""in it together, from first to last"". They might have fallen out but they were side by side again in court, united by the two things they will forever share - guilt at destroying a globally-beloved landmark and too much cowardice to admit it.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e3dvjkdmxo,"""Lights, camera… tariff?"" - that's the question a scrambling movie industry has been asking this week after an unexpected intervention from US President Donald Trump. Writing on his Truth Social platform last Sunday, Trump announced plans to hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he attempts to stop Hollywood dying ""a very fast death"". His threat comes as studios increasingly shift productions abroad to places such as the UK. The White House has since clarified that ""no final decision"" has been made and that they're ""exploring all options"" for revitalising the US film industry. But Trump's suggestion alone has sent shockwaves through the industry - from Hollywood to Hertfordshire - so what might all of this mean in practice? In 2014, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was shot by Disney at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, and Hollywood has kept growing closer to the UK since. Last year alone, the British Film Institute says 65% of UK production spend came from the five major US film studios and three US streaming giants - Netflix, Apple and Amazon. This amounted to £1.37bn ($1.71bn), a near 50% jump on 2023. In Hollywood, by contrast, film and television production in Los Angeles has dropped by nearly 40% over the past decade. The reason? Well largely, it's cheaper to make films in the UK. That's thanks to generous tax incentives such as the Film Tax Relief, which offers a 25% tax rebate - as well as lower labour costs and centralised national funding for film. As British actor Brian Cox told Times Radio on Tuesday: ""The reality is films go where they can afford."" For Universal's blockbuster Jurassic World: Dominion, these incentives delivered a reported £89.1m ($111.38m) in savings. In the US, tax incentives operate on a state level - and Hollywood has relatively poor tax breaks - not only compared with the UK, which can offer 10% more, but other states such as New York and Georgia, too. Fixing that is no easy task. Trump has appointed Golden Globe Award-winning actor Jon Voight, 86, as a special ambassador to Hollywood, and met with him a day before dropping his light-on-detail proposal. But it's not exactly clear how tariffs would solve the internal tax problem in the US. A possible solution, raised by Voight, is a federal tax incentive to mirror the UK. The Wrap's film reporter Jeremy Fuster tells the BBC it is ""unlikely"", in the current highly-charged climate, that Republicans would ""support a federal tax incentive that can easily be portrayed as a handout to 'woke Hollywood'"". And what would the impact be on moviegoers if the levy goes ahead? Fuster says costs, like any other tariffed good, would be passed onto audiences through ticket prices, premium on-demand increases or subscription rates. How exactly this would take form is ""something nobody knows"". It's not all about the money, because while a boost to US production could benefit parts of the industry, some projects will still need to shoot abroad. ""Amazon isn't going to make the next James Bond entirely in America,"" Fuster notes. Culture minister Sir Chris Bryant has said the UK government is in ""active discussions with the top of the US administration"" on the ""very fluid"" situation. With all this in mind, do you know which films have been made in the UK in recent years? BBC News has looked at some below - and they might be closer to home than you think. Warner Bros Leavesden studio in Hertfordshire, best known for producing the Harry Potter films, has been used as the set for numerous Hollywood blockbusters including Barbie, Mickey 17, Venom: The Last Dance and Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. The nearby Sky Studios Elstree in Borehamwood was turned into the magical world of Oz in 2023 as it welcomed its first production, Wicked. Beyond Hertfordshire, cities such as Glasgow have long been used as a filming hub for Hollywood movies. The opening scene of Brad Pitt's zombie thriller, World War Z, may look like Philadelphia, but the film was actually shot in George Square in the Scottish city. In November, the city was transformed into a dystopian New York as Glen Powell was spotted filming for forthcoming thriller The Running Man. It's not just dystopian films that are shot in Glasgow - in 2021, star-spangled banners, bunting and vintage shop fronts decorated the streets of Glasgow city centre for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The city was used for a parade scene which appears to capture 1960s New York as Apollo astronauts return home. The latest Indiana Jones movie was also shot in Northern England with Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland being used in the opening scenes. The castle doubled up for 1944 war-torn Nazi Germany. Other scenes were shot along the North York Moors railway line in Grosmont, and the Leaderfoot Viaduct, over the River Tweed, near Melrose, in the Scottish Borders. In 2022, The Batman used Glasgow Cathedral, the Necropolis and the Bridge of Sighs to create Gotham City, which is based on New York. Speaking to the BBC in 2022 about the choice in filming location, director Matt Reeves said it was important to film in a location where there was ""beautiful Gothic architecture"". ""I wanted this to feel like a Gothic American city, but one that you'd never been to,"" he said. ""So we went to Glasgow and honestly it was so beautiful."" The film's lead actor, Robert Pattinson, said: ""It looks great as Gotham, who would've thought of all the cities in the world, Glasgow as Gotham?"" Central Saint Martins art school in London was also used as a building in Gotham City, as was some parts of Liverpool. Keen-eyed fans will spot that Gotham City Police Department is actually the Liver Building's clock tower, although the giant Liver Bird was airbrushed out. Spider-Man spin-off Morbius was filmed in Manchester's Northern Quarter and in 2010, the city became 1940s Brooklyn for Captain America: The First Avenger, starring Chris Evans. Liverpool's early 20th Century buildings has also made it a popular stand-in for New York's older skyscrapers. Liverpool was transformed into 1920s New York for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which sees Eddie Redmayne search the city for his escaped magical beasts. Disney's recent live-action Snow White movie was almost entirely filmed in the UK, with Pinewood Studios used for many indoor scenes and sets. A quarry in the Lake District, a beach in Pembrokshire, Wales and a nature reserve in Burnham were all also used as shooting locations. As well as Snow White, Netflix's new thriller Havoc, starring Tom Hardy and set in an unnamed US city, was filmed in Wales. The film's Welsh director Gareth Evans, said it was ""challenging"" to recreate a US city in south Wales, but he wanted to bring more work to the area. Swansea's Brangwyn Hall doubled up as the exterior of a fictional city police station while Cardiff's Bute Street was turned into a US boulevard with 30cm (12in) of fake snow for one of Havoc's night-time scenes. Other recent Hollywood blockbusters that have seen the majority of their filming - known as principal photography - in the UK, include: Jenny Watt runs a handful of death cafés across Glasgow, encouraging discussion about the topic. A London Zoo employee spent almost three years on a digital recreation of how it looked in 1904. Croydon East MP Natasha Irons says the council's approach shut out the voices that should be heard. The first mayor of London was elected in May 2000 - we mark 25 years with these memorable images. The pioneering work of Henry Peach Robinson is being remembered in Leamington, Warwickshire.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d1pngdjzmo,"Families of Israeli hostages taken to Gaza in the 7 October attacks have expressed their increasing concern about the fates of loved ones, as doubts grow about how many are still alive. One family said the hostages were at risk ""every day"" they continued to be held captive by Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this week there was ""uncertainty"" over the condition of three of the 24 hostages previously believed to be alive. He was reacting to US President Donald Trump's statement on Tuesday that only 21 of those taken in the Hamas-led attacks were still alive. The BBC spoke to two families - including the brother of a hostage released by Hamas this year - after Israel's security cabinet approved an expanded offensive in Gaza. Netanyahu said ministers had decided on a ""forceful operation"" to destroy Hamas and rescue the hostages, and that Gaza's 2.1 million population ""will be moved, to protect it"". One family told the BBC they hoped the troops would only be used to help with the aim of freeing the hostages, not for any other reasons. Liran Berman's twin brothers Gali and Ziv have been held by Hamas for 19 months after they were kidnapped from their home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed by Hamas-led gunmen that day, while Gali and Ziv were among 251 others who were taken hostage. More than 52,780 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel cut off all deliveries of aid and other supplies on 2 March and resumed its offensive two weeks later after it broke a two-month ceasefire that saw 33 Israeli and five Thai hostages released in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Following news of Israel's plan to expand its military operation in Gaza using thousands more troops unless Hamas agreed a new ceasefire and released the remaining hostages, Liran Berman told BBC News: ""I hope that Israel is sending the forces to put pressure on Hamas to sit down. ""When Hamas was feeling threatened, they did the deals. I hope they are not sending the troops to conquer or for revenge."" Mr Berman said his 27-year-old brothers were ""at risk every single day"". ""We know they are alive. The released hostages saw them."" He said he believed Gali and Ziv had been injured when they were seized but that he worried their mental condition was ""not good"" after so long in captivity. With the release of emaciated and frail hostages in February, Mr Berman said he was worried about his brothers' conditions. ""We need to pressure Hamas and its enablers."" For 491 days, Or Levy was held by Hamas not knowing whether his wife Einav had survived the 7 October attack on the Nova music festival where he was taken. She didn't and for more than a year his three-year-old son Almog was without both his parents. In February, Or, weak and painfully thin, was released by Hamas. His brother, Michael Levy, told BBC News he was worried about the impact on the hostages if Israel sent more troops into Gaza. ""I'm concerned it will affect the hostages, that the terrorists can decide to do something to them,"" he said. ""I do believe the army knows what it's doing and they will make sure the hostages aren't affected, but it's always a concern."" But he said he wanted more pressure applied to get them released. ""There is a crime against humanity and everyone including President Trump needs to do more in order to bring them back."" He said his brother did not receive enough food while he was held hostage in Hamas's underground tunnels in Gaza and ""didn't see sunlight"". He said he showered ""every two months or so"". ""My brother worries about the fact the rest of the hostages will end up dying in captivity because that was his worst fear about himself and it's now his worst fear about those he left behind."" Of the 251 people taken hostage on 7 October - and the four other captives held by Hamas for around a decade before the attacks - 59 now remain in Gaza. The Israeli government has publicly confirmed the deaths of 35, leaving 24 hostages. There is now uncertainty about the fate of three of them. All 59 were kidnapped in the 7 October attack apart from one - the soldier Hadar Goldin who was killed in combat in Gaza during a previous war in 2014. The living hostages are men in their 20s or 30s, apart from Omri Miran who turned 48 in April. Of the 35 whose bodies Israel has confirmed are being held in Gaza, nearly all are men who were between 19 and 86 years old when they died. Three are women. Since the spate of releases earlier this year, former hostages have been speaking to the media and others about their time in captivity. Tal Shoham, 49, released in February after 505 days, told a UN event last month: ""There were many times that we received just one pita bread for an entire day… Traumatised by hunger, we collected crumb after crumb."" Eliya Cohen, 28, who was also held for 505 days, told Israel's Channel 12 that once a week Hamas gunmen would make him and other hostages take off all their clothes and would tell them: ""You you're not quite there, you're not thin enough... I'm thinking about cutting the food even more."" Ilana Gritzewsky was released during another ceasefire in November 2023. Her partner Matan Zangauker is still a hostage. The 31-year-old told the New York Times in March that as she was kidnapped from her home she was molested by one of the kidnappers. The article says she believes she was also sexually assaulted in Gaza. ""When she came to, she said, she found herself on the floor in a dilapidated building, clearly in Gaza, her shirt up baring her breasts and pants pulled down, with seven gunmen standing over her."" Ron Krivoi, a sound engineer, was kidnapped from the Nova music festival. Last month, The Times of Israel quoted a Channel 12 interview in which he described the tunnels. ""We were inside a very, very small cage… and we had to lie down and rest in it – you couldn't stand. No height, no toilets, no food. We were five people."" The action, which affects hundreds of Palestinian pupils, comes after an Israeli ban on Unrwa this year. The restaurant in Gaza City's Rimal neighbourhood had been recently been operating a community kitchen. The director of Eurovision said no participating EBU member had publicly opposed Israeli broadcaster Kan's participation. A senior official rejects US President Donald Trump's claim the Yemeni group ""capitulated"" when agreeing a ceasefire deal. The UN also expresses alarm after Israel approves a new plan that may include seizing all of Gaza indefinitely and controlling aid. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq54d4w5131o,"""Whatever I was doing - maybe cleaning up or doing homework - when I heard the 'oooh-oooh-oooooh',"" Adesoji Kukoyi says, mimicking the iconic Doctor Who theme tune, ""I dropped everything and ran straight to the television."" As a child growing up in 1980s Nigeria, Mr Kukoyi was infatuated with sci-fi sensation Doctor Who. British shows like Allo Allo and Fawlty Towers aired regularly as a cultural hangover from the colonial era, but none captured Mr Kukoyi's imagination like the time-travelling Doctor did. ""He always spoke to me,"" 44-year-old Mr Kukoyi, who currently has a vintage Doctor Who theme as the ringtone on his phone, tells the BBC. ""Like there's somebody watching out for us... yes, we make mistakes, but we do our best, especially if we have a teacher that will lead us on the right path."" Mr Kukoyi has been watching Doctor Who for decades, so when he heard that on Saturday an episode will, for the very first time, be set in Nigeria, he was elated. ""I was watching last week's episode with my wife and the preview [for the following week] said: 'Welcome to Lagos, Nigeria'. I screamed like a little girl!"" Mr Kukoyi says. The setting is momentous not just for Mr Kukoyi - a native of Nigeria's biggest and liveliest city Lagos - but for the show too. Saturday's adventure will be the first primarily set in Africa. It is fitting that the producers chose Nigeria for this milestone - in 2013, fans worldwide were delighted when nine lost Doctor Who episodes from the 1960s were unearthed in a Nigerian TV facility. Ariyon Bakare, who in the upcoming episode plays the mysterious Barber, says fans can expect ""a time-bending cultural ancestral collision"" and ""hair, lots of hair"". The preview also teases a vibrant barber shop, a brimming Lagos market and a towering, monstrous-looking spider. Fans speculate that this creature is Anansi, a legendary character in West African and Caribbean folktales, but scriptwriter Inua Ellams is keeping specifics under wraps. As for why the show has enjoyed such popularity in Nigeria, he says: ""There's something Nigerian about the Doctor. Nigerians are sort of loud, gregarious people... the Doctor is mysterious, boisterous, sort of over-confident but somehow manages to save the day."" Ellams, who moved from Nigeria to the UK as a child, also considers why in 62 years, a character known to traverse the universe has barely spent any time in Africa. It could be that no writer has felt confident enough to produce an authentic African story, he says, or it might be down to the Doctor's need to ""blend into his environment and be inconspicuous"". ""Ncuti Gatwa [who plays the Doctor] being an actor of African descent means that we can tell new stories with the Doctor and negotiate in different spaces because of his appearance. ""And this is the brilliance of the show - every Doctor creates new opportunities to tell new stories in different ways,"" Ellams tells the BBC. But these fresh Doctor Who stories have a smaller reach than the old ones did, as the show is no longer broadcast on Nigerian public TV. If you are in the country and want to catch up on the Doctor's exploits, you would have to subscribe to streaming service Disney Plus. Regardless, Mr Kukoyi insists that a dedicated troop of Nigerian Doctor Who lovers will be sitting transfixed on their sofas on Saturday evening, bearing witness to the Tardis materialising in Lagos. ""I'm waiting with baited breath,"" he says. ""Finally, he is coming!"" Mr Kukoyi - whose first experience of the Doctor was one played by a stripy scarf-wearing Tom Baker - says his young daughters are not so taken with his beloved show. He is ""trying to get them onboard"", he says. Perhaps seeing the Doctor wearing traditional Nigerian clothing, squeezing his way through a quintessential Lagos market and getting caught up in local folklore will help them fall in love with the show the way their father once did.

India and Pakistan both claim Kashmir in full Edited by Matt Spivey in London Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif says the country's military has given a ""befitting response"" to India as the conflict intensifies. ""Today, we have given India a befitting response and avenged the blood of innocent lives,"" he says in a statement. We're hearing now from Pakistan's information minister, Attaullah Tarar, who says the country's forces have a right to respond to India's aggression. ""Pakistan is not the provocateur,"" he tells BBC News Channel. ""Pakistan now has a right to respond."" As we've been reporting, houses and cars were damaged in a civilian area in Jammu, in India-administered Kashmir, following an early morning attack, locals told the BBC. Tarar denies targeting civilian populations. When challenged, he says the country has only targeted military installations. Earlier, India accused Pakistan of using high-speed missiles to target its bases and moving troops ""into forward areas"" in an escalation of hostilities. Divya Arya
Reporting from Jammu, in Indian-administered Kashmir Houses were damaged and car windows smashed in Rehadi colony, in Jammu city, following an early morning attack, locals have told the BBC. This is the first time a civilian area in the heart of the city has been targeted, they said. Rakesh Gupta, a local resident, “heard a loud sound and plumes of smoke enveloped the neighbourhood"". ""There was panic and chaos. Why is Pakistan targeting ordinary people?” A few people were injured and have been taken to a nearby hospital, we were told. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah came to the spot while the BBC team was there, but he had to leave suddenly when jets started flying overhead. Air raid sirens were sounded and people were asked to clear out. The UK continues to ""monitor closely"" the developments between Pakistan and India, Jane Marriott, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan says. ""Airspace closures are currently in place, and further restrictions may be announced or changed at short notice,"" she said in a post on X. Tensions between Delhi and Islamabad have escalated further since Friday night as a series of drone strikes were reported from both sides. Anbarasan Ethirajan
South Asia regional editor, reporting from Delhi As I was rushing from my hotel to the BBC bureau this morning, the taxi driver was anxious to know whether a conflict will break out with Pakistan. On his phone he showed me a picture of the remnants of a projectile which he said landed close to his village, close to the border in India’s Punjab province. He said it was sent by his brother who’s living in the village. The BBC can’t independently verify this photo, but it seems people here are now getting information from their family members living in villages and towns along the border areas. Delhi looked normal this morning, with buses, cars and auto rickshaws chugging along, and tea sellers on the pavements. There were reports about remnants of a projectile in the town of Sirsa, not far from Delhi, but it’s not clear who fired and where it came from. People are realising that skirmishes are now a reality, not something that’s happening far away on the border with Pakistan. Others are being asked to stay indoors in several places in the border states. There’s also lots of misinformation and fake news causing confusion and worry among people. We've one final update to bring you from the briefing in India - and it comes from Col Sofiya Qureshi, who we heard from a little earlier. Pakistan's military, she says, has been observed ""moving their troops into forward areas, indicating offensive intent to further escalate the situation"". ""Indian armed forces remain in a high state of operational readiness,"" she tells the briefing. ""All hostile actions have been effectively countered and responded appropriately. Indian armed forces reiterate their commitment to non-escalation, provided it is reciprocated by the Pakistan military."" Pakistan has not commented on whether it's moving troops closer to the border with India. Indian Air Force's Wing Commander Vyomika Singh and Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri both deny that Pakistani strikes have caused any damage to military infrastructure in India. ""Pakistan has also attempted to execute a continued malicious misinformation campaign, with claims of destruction of the Indian S-400 system at Adampur, destruction of airfields at Surat and Sirsa, Brahmos space at Nagrota, artillery gun positions in Derangyari and Chandigarh ammunitions depot, with heavy damage to other military stations being propagated on social media,"" Singh says, adding: ""India unequivocally rejects these false claims being spread by Pakistan."" India carried out a swift and calibrated response - forces spokesperson We're now hearing from Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, of the Indian Air Force, who says Pakistan carried out ""aggressive actions employing multiple threat vectors"" around India's western border. She says Pakistan used a plethora of weapons - including drones and long-range weapons - ""to target civil and areas and military infrastructure"". ""Pakistan's military also targeted air intuitions, using drones and firing of heavy-calibre weapons along the Line of Control."" Next, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri tells those gathered: ""I have said on numerous earlier occasions, it is Pakistani actions that have constituted provocations and escalations. ""In response, India has defended and reacted in a responsible and measured fashion to these provocations and escalations by the Pakistani side. ""Earlier this morning, we saw a repeat of this escalatory and provocative pattern."" We're now hearing from Col Sofiya Qureshi, of the Indian Army. She starts the briefing by accusing Pakistan of using high-speed missiles to target Indian airbases. It comes hours after Pakistan accused India of targeting three of its military airbases with missile strikes. While we wait to hear from Indian government officials, here's another update from Indian-administered Kashmir. Additional Deputy Commissioner Raj Kumar Thapa, in Rajouri town, has died due to shelling from Pakistan, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah says. ""Devastating news from Rajouri. We have lost a dedicated officer of the Jammu and Kashmir Administration Services,"" Abdullah says in a post on X. ""Today, the residence of the officer was hit by Pak [Pakistani] shelling as they targeted Rajouri town killing our Additional District Development Commissioner Sh [Shri] Raj Kumar Thappa. I’ve no words to express my shock and sadness at this terrible loss of life."" Government officials have told the BBC that at least two more people, both civilians, have been killed in Jammu city in Indian-administered Kashmir. We're due to hear from India's foreign and defence ministries shortly, hours after Pakistan's military said it was launching retaliatory strikes on India. That decision came after Pakistan's claim that India had struck three of its airbases - a claim India has not commented on. We'll bring you live updates and you'll be able to watch the news conference when it gets going. Just tap the watch live button at the top of the page. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has spoken to both Pakistani army chief Asim Munir and India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. A handout says Rubio urged both sides to find ways to de-escalate the situation. Rubio offered US assistance in starting ""constructive talks in order to avoid future conflicts"" on his call with Munir and - when talking to Jaishankar - called on both sides to reduce tensions. The Indian army says Pakistan's ""blatant escalation"" - using drone strikes and other munitions - continues along India's western borders. In one such attempt at approximately 05:00 local time (23:30 Friday GMT), the army goes on, multiple enemy armed drones were spotted flying over Khasa Cantonment in Amritsar city, Punjab state, India. ""The hostile drones were instantly engaged and destroyed by our air defence units,"" the army says in a statement on X. ""Pakistan’s blatant attempt to violate India’s sovereignty and endanger civilians is unacceptable. Indian will thwart enemy designs."" Reports of explosions have been coming from several places along the Line of Control, the de facto border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir, since the early hours of Saturday. BBC reporters have heard explosions in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Srinagar and Jammu cities. The source of these explosions has not been identified. Local media has also reported hearing the sound of explosions from Udhampur in Indian-administered Kashmir and Pathankot in Punjab - both places have Indian defence installations that Pakistan claims to have targeted. Earlier, Pakistan claimed India had fired missiles at airbases in Rawalpindi - 10km (6.2m) from Pakistan's capital Islamabad - Chakwal and Shorkot. India is yet to comment on these claims. Images, released early on Saturday, show smoke billowing in Jammu in Indian-administered Kashmir Anbarasan Ethirajan
South Asia regional editor This is the moment few would have wanted to see happening in the subcontinent. Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan are now firing missiles at each other. It's a dangerous one in the ongoing military escalation by both countries. The Pakistani military says it has destroyed an Indian airbase, airfield and a missile storage unit in India. If it’s true, that’s a massive provocation. Islamabad said it was in response to India's missile strikes, including one close to the capital Islamabad. There has been no confirmation yet from the Indian side on Pakistan’s version of events. After days of drone warfare, the two countries appear to have been fallen into an unknown, rather troubling territory. The scale and intensity of the current skirmishes is the worst in three decades. The nature of the damage suffered by both sides will determine the next course of action in both capitals. The international community must be worried at this point. With passions running high on both sides, it’s anybody’s guess on how far the escalation will be ratcheted up. Azadeh Moshiri
Pakistan correspondent, reporting from Islamabad ""An eye for an eye"", ""Pakistan responds"". These are statements by Pakistan's military as it discusses what it’s called Operation Bunyanun Marsoos. The army claims the counter-offensive is ongoing, with a spokesman saying it is targeting all air bases from which India had launched it's missiles. A field supply depot, a battery site, artillery gun position and brigade headquarters are claimed to have been hit. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called a meeting of the National Command Authority, as the window for de-escalation appears to shrink. The body is responsible for Pakistan's nuclear assets. Pakistan's army is making a series of claims, including that it has destroyed India's S-400 defence systems. It also says that it's launched a cyber-attack and hacked some of India's top websites, including that of the ruling BJP party. The BBC cannot independently verify these claims, and India is yet to comment on them. The BJP's website, however, is opening in India. Aamir Peerzada
Reporting from Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir An eyewitness living near Srinagar airport tells me that he earlier heard what sounded like a jet flying close to the airport, followed by explosions. He did not time the first occurrence, but on the second he said the explosion happened 13 seconds after the jet passed. Another eyewitness, also near the airport, told me that at around 06:20 am local (00:50 GMT), ""there was the sound of a jet, followed by an explosion"". They then saw a flare of smoke. Shortly after reported strikes at around 03:15 local time (22:15 GMT) - which Pakistan claim were Indian and hit three of its airbases - Pakistan's Airports Authority closed the country's airspace to all traffic until midday local time. And in the last few moments, the Airports Authority of India has announced it is closing 32 airports across the north and west of the country until the morning of 15 May. Copyright © 2025 BBC.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e3d888p44o,"Not long after greeting crowds from the balcony overlooking St Peter's Square on Thursday evening, Pope Leo XIV returned to the Sant'Uffizio Palace, where he had been living for the last two months. He was met by a jubilant group of staff and former colleagues, all eager to shake his hand and congratulate him. A young girl handed him a Bible to bless and sign. ""Of course, though I have to try out my new signature,"" Pope Leo said with a smile. ""The old one is of no use anymore."" He had only stopped being Robert Francis Prevost a few hours before, when he was elected pope. As he took on the name Leo XIV, a new life began for the 69-year-old Chicago-born cardinal. But details on how Pope Leo will be looking to run the Catholic Church are still scarce, and so over the next few days and weeks every small clue – from his attire to his choice of accommodation – will be examined. Scrutiny began as soon as he stepped on to the balcony, giving the crowd a glimpse of the vestments he chose for his first appearance. The gold cross around his neck that caught the evening light was seen as a first sign he was departing from the simplicity of his predecessor's simple silver pendant; the embroidered stole and red mozzetta cemented that impression. Then, the fact that the homily he delivered to cardinals in the Sistine Chapel on Friday morning was scripted – rather than improvised – also sent a signal that ""Leo will be more closely aligned to tradition than Francis was,"" said Austen Ivereigh, a Catholic writer and commentator. But several events over the next few days and weeks will give Pope Leo a further chance to sketch out the priorities of his pontificate. On Monday he is due to hold an audience with the media and on 18 May he will celebrate a solemn inaugural mass in St Peter's Square. As part of that mass he will deliver a homily in the presence of numerous heads of state and dignitaries. In his 2013 inaugural homily, Pope Francis asked ""all those who have positions of responsibility in economic, political and social life"" to be ""protectors of creation, of God's plan… of one another and of the environment"". So that moment might also provide clues about the matters dearest to Pope Leo's heart. The new Pope's choice of accommodation too will be significant. Francis made the choice of choosing to live in the simple Casa Santa Marta guesthouse, which was seen as revolutionary, but Leo may well decide to follow in the footsteps of virtually all his predecessors and reside in the grand Apostolic Palace. ""He was elected less than a day ago; let's give him time to decide,"" Vatican sources quoted by Italian media said. ""These are all important choices,"" Ivereigh added. ""Over the next few days we'll be learning more and more about it – the first week of the pontificate is a constant revelation."" Meanwhile, in the absence of details about his future as Leo XIV, fragments of the Pope's old life as Robert Prevost are emerging from around the world. This is the case especially in his native Chicago and his adopted homeland of Peru, of which he became a citizen in 2015. In one photo, he is presented with a large handmade birthday card written in Spanish and surrounded by cakes and balloons. A video recorded when he left Peru for Rome, in which he says he would miss the ""joy"" of Peru and staples of local cuisine like ceviche, has been met with triumph by South American social media users. ""The pope is Peruvian; God loves Peru,"" Peruvian President Dina Boluarte said. American tourists ambling in St Peter's Square on the day after the election were more restrained, and a bit frazzled by the news that the new Pope is from the US. ""I'm still surprised they chose an American, to be honest,"" said Chicagoan Kerry, who is in Rome on her honeymoon. She admitted she didn't yet know much about the new Pope but was pleased by rumours that he is a fan of the White Sox baseball team. Asked how she thought Pope Leo felt today, she laughed: ""He must be really overwhelmed; I bet he didn't sleep a wink!"" Her husband Joseph agreed: ""When you're elected Pope you come here as a cardinal for the conclave but then things never go back to the way they were,"" he said. But he felt like the new Pope seemed to be ""a man of confidence, prayer and humility"". ""I just pray that he shows the world what being a man of God can do."" The newly-weds posed for a picture with the day's newspapers, then wandered off into St Peter's Square, resplendent in the spring sunshine. Retired Bishop Michael Campbell remembers the day the future pontiff visited Lancaster in 2008. Pope Leo XIV has supported his predecessor and focus will turn on whether he continues Church reforms. Born in the Windy City in 1955 to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent, Prevost served as an altar boy and was ordained in 1982. Anna Rowlands says the pontiff was ""slightly overwhelmed"", but his serenity was also ""intensified"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vg8k4zxk9o,"The 2025 Eurovision Song Contest pops its cork on Sunday, with a ""turquoise carpet"" parade featuring competitors from all 37 nations. But the competition really begins on Tuesday, when the first semi-final will see five countries unceremoniously kicked out. Another six will lose their place at the second semi-final on Thursday, before the Grand Final takes place in Basel, Switzerland, on Saturday, 17 May. This year's entrants include two returning contestants, one professional opera singer, a thinly veiled allusion to sexual emissions and a dance anthem about a dead space dog. It's a lot to take in. To help you prepare, here's a guide to all 37 songs in the contest, which I've sorted into rough musical categories, mainly for my own sanity (it didn't work). Win or lose, UK contestants Remember Monday have given headline writers a gift with the title of their entry: What The Hell Just Happened? A souped-up, full throttle pop anthem, it cherry-picks the best bits of Queen, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Beatles, presumably to remind voters of Britain's rich musical heritage. With eight tempo changes, it could prove tricky for voters to grasp, but the band's stellar harmonies and sparkling personalities should carry them through. Crucially, the song avoids the Eurovision cliches of jackhammer dance anthems and windswept balladry – something Remember Monday have in common with this year's favourites. Sweating it out at the top are Swedish representatives KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the restorative powers of the sauna, complete with dancers in skimpy towels. Unreasonably catchy, it's won the approval of Abba's Bjorn Ulvaeus, whose been singing the track in his own private sauna. As you do. Stiff competition comes from Austrian singer JJ, and his operatic ballad Wasted Love. A timeworn story of unrequited love, it leans on his training as a counter-tenor, before exploding into an unexpected techno breakdown. A favourite with the bookies, the song's only Achilles heel is its similarity to last year's winner, Nemo. Distinctive in a different way is Ireland's entry, Laika Party – a 90s trance-pop anthem about a dog who was sent to space by Russia and left to die there. Singer Emmy aims for a hopeful spin on a tragic story but, despite a peppy performance, it's a bit of a downer. More palatable is Luxembourg's Laura Thorn, whose La Poupée Monte Le Son is a callback to France Gall's 1965 winning entry, Poupée De Cire, Poupée De Son. Where the original was about a ""fashion doll"" operated by songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, Thorn's response is all about taking control. ""If you think a man like you can manipulate me, go back to your mum,"" she scolds. Yeouch. Rome must be blushing. This year features not one, but two, songs about the vibrant culture of Il Bel Paese. The first comes, not surprisingly, from San Marino – the independent microstate that nestles inside north-central Italy. Titled Tutta L'Italia, it celebrates everything from the county's football team and its vineyards, to the Mona Lisa (under her Italian name Gioconda). Written by Gabry Ponte – one of the brains behind Eiffel 65's Blue (Da Ba Dee) – it's a slight, but fun, mixture of dance beats, traditional accordion playing and the folk dances of Calabria. The staging could be its downfall, though, with Gabry marooned behind his DJ decks while the singers, who for some reason wish to remain anonymous, obscure their faces with masks. More memorable, but definitely more unhinged, is Estonia's Espresso Macchiato. Performed by Tommy Cash (the only Eurovision contestant to have appeared on a Charli XCX record) it's an affectionate-ish caricature of Italian stereotypes, featuring the indelible lyric: ""Life is like spaghetti, it's hard until you make it"". I'm trying to give up sexual innuendo, but Eurovision is making it har... difficult. A trio of artists are trying to sneak smut past the censors, led by Malta's Miriana Conte, with a throbbing club track called Serving. In its original form, the song's chorus revolved around the phrase ""serving kant"" – the word kant being Maltese for ""singing"" and a homophone for an English term that definitely doesn't mean singing. It's a reference to a well-known phrase in the drag / ballroom world; but several countries complained it broke broadcasting guidelines, prompting a hasty re-write. If the stunt was meant to generate headlines it worked, but now that Miriana has our attention, she's not letting go. Her performance, featuring a giant disco ball pursed between two red lips, is gloriously OTT, and she has an enviable set of pipes. Too bad the song is riddled with Europop cliche. Another contestant doubling his entendres is Australia's Go-Jo, who wants us to ""take a sip"" of milkshake from his ""special cup"". Interpret that how you want but I'd be wary of hitching a lift in his ice cream van, if I were you. With a smattering of Electric Six's saucy disco funk, Milkshake Man is tasty enough to get Australia back in the finals after only achieving a semi last year. Finally, we have Finland's Erika Vikman, whose song Ich Komme is billed as a ""joyous message of pleasure, ecstasy and a state of trance"". Structured to mimic the pneumatic realities of lovemaking, it recalls iconic gay anthems such as Kylie's Your Disco Needs You and Donna Summer's Hot Stuff – and ends with Erika shooting into the sky astride a massive gold microphone that's definitely not a stand-in for a phallus. Little in life is more devastating than the phrase ""I'm afraid it's cancer"". The disease will affect one in two of us and, although survival rates have dramatically improved, the impact can be devastating. This year, three separate Eurovision contestants have been touched by cancer, inspiring songs of unmatched heartbreak and reflection. French singer Louane captures it best. Her song Maman, is an intimate conversation with her mother, who died when she was just 17 years old. Over three verses, Louane describes the ""emptiness"" she was felt; and how she filled the void with bad behaviour and meaningless love affairs. But, as the song progresses, she tells her mum she's settled down and found purpose... by becoming a mother herself. She sings it beautifully, with a mixture of regret and strength. And when her daughter's voice appears in the final moments of the song, it would take a steely heart not to shed a tear. Over in Norway, 19-year-old Kyle Alessandro shared a similar story, when his mother was diagnosed with cancer in autumn 2023. Thankfully, she's now in remission, but something she said during her treatment inspired his Eurovision entry: ""Never lose your light."" Kyle took that phrase and turned it into a thumping pop song about surviving adversity. ""Nothing can burn me now,"" he sings. ""I'm my own Lighter."" Klemen Slakonja, meanwhile, is a comedian best known in Slovenia for his impressions of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin - but his ballad, How Much Time Do We Have Left was written after his wife, actress Mojca Fatur, was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer. As he sings, Klemen's dancers raise him into the air and hold him upside down, to represent the disorientation the family felt. ""When she read her diagnosis, our world turned upside down and I felt that rush of blood in my head, the same one I feel whenever I am upside down in the performance,"" he told Eurovision World. Defying the odds, Mojca survived, and joins him on stage at Eurovision. It's a deeply intimate and moving moment. Listening to this year's line-up, it's like the contestants all heard Cascada's Evacuate the Dancefloor and went, ""Nah, we're good, thanks"". There are club bangers everywhere, with Belgium's Red Sebastian (named after the crab in The Little Mermaid, bless him) submitting an entire song about the loved-up liberation of an all-night rave. ""Where no words are needed to feel the connection / Where clocks never tick and where love is the ending."" A favourite with fans, the 90s rave elements of Strobe Lights feel a little dated to me, but his meticulously-choreographed performance is a treat. Denmark's Sissal takes a similar sound, with a throwback Euro-bop called Hallucination that effortlessly evokes two-time Eurovision winner Loreen. Sissal said her biggest goal was for the audience to feel they couldn't sit down during the song. Mission accomplished. Germany, meanwhile, are pitching for a home run with Baller, a super-catchy trance anthem that wouldn't sound out of place at Berlin superclub Berghain. Performed by Austrian siblings Abor & Tynna, it's languishing in the middle of the field, after Tynna developed laryngitis, robbing the duo of the chance to impress fans at Eurovision's various pre-parties. But now that she's recovered, the song could rise up the rankings. That's less likely for Væb, aka the Icelandic Jedward. Their energetic dance-rap song, Roá, is all about rowing from Iceland to the Faroe Islands, ""because no matter what happens in life you just keep on rowing through the waves"". Sadly, it's not as deep as it sounds. Spanish star Melody fares better with Esa Diva, a pumping house track with a sprinkling of flamenco guitar, that documents her journey to fame. And Azerbaijan's Mamagama go all Maroon 5 on Run With U, a smooth pop song elevated by a twinkling riff on the saz – a long-necked plucked instrument similar to the lute. OK, so I've stolen that description from Shkodra Elektronike. They're an Albanian duo living in Italy, who fuse the ethnic music of their hometown, Shkodër, to a progressive electronic sound. Their song Zjerm (Fire) imagines a time when cross-cultural understanding would lead to peace and harmony – a world without a need for soldiers and ambulances, and where ""oil would smell like lilac"" (no, me neither). Greece's entry, Asteromáta, is also rooted in history and memory, as Klavdia describes the unbreakable bond that refugees share with their homeland. ""Even if they cross the seas / They shall never forget the sacred earth they called home,"" she sings, in a haunting ballad that blends traditional Greek and Pontic elements with soaring strings. Taking a more upbeat approach is Dutch singer Claude. A refugee from the bloody civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he moved to the Netherlands at the age of nine and fell in love with Eurovision while waiting in the refugee centre. His song, C'est La Vie, is a tribute to his mum, who taught him to see the positive in their situation. Fizzing with freedom and joy, it combines elements of chanson and French-Caribbean zouk, and looks set for a top 10 placing. The success of ""goth gremlin witch"" Bambie Thug at last year's Eurovision has conjured a veritable coven of imitators in 2025. Polish singer Justyna Steczkowska, representing her country for the second time, even includes a Slavic magic spell in her song, Gaja – summoning the spirit of the mother Earth to ""cleanse"" her of a toxic relationship. It's a suitably intense performance, with Justyna singing long sustained notes and playing a furious violin solo, before being hoiked into the rafters on a pair ropes. What a time to be alive. Marko Bošnjak, meanwhile, is cooking up a Poison Cake to feed to his tormentors - chiefly the people who bombarded him with homophobic hate messages after he was selected to represent Croatia. The criticism was so intense that he lost his voice and couldn't leave the house for five days. His song is suitably melodramatic, replete with guttural synths and creepy playground chants. It's a little overbaked, but should still sail through to the finals. Taking a more ethereal approach are Latvian group Tautumeitas, whose song Bur Man Laimi translates as ""a chant for happiness"". Reminiscent of Bjork and Enya, its overlapping folk harmonies are based on traditional Latvian wedding songs, making it one of this year's most captivating entries. I fear it may be too subtle to score well, though. Further mystery is provided by, Theo Evan, Cyprus's answer to Nick Jonas. The lyrics to his song, Shh, are a riddle, written by former tennis player Elke Tiel, whose ""hidden truth will only be revealed on the Eurovision stage in May"". He opens his performance perched between two pieces of scaffolding in a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man sketch – so there's a clue. Shh is one of a number of gothic pop songs, sung by brooding young men with interesting hair. Among the best is Kiss Kiss Goodbye, by Czechia's Adonxs, who divebombs from an angelic falsetto to an unsettling baritone as he confronts his absent father. Lithuanian band Katarsis are an interesting experiment, with a deliberately downbeat rock song that declares ""the foundations of everything have begun to rot"". Titled Tavo Akys (your eyes), it builds to a compelling climax, but it's hard to see it being a vote-winner, unless Eurovision suddenly attracts an audience of depressed emo teens. Rounding out the field are Armenian singer Parg, with the Imagine Dragons-inspired Survivor and Serbia's Princ, whose overwrought ballad is called Mila. Both performers give it their all, but the songs don't feel strong enough to survive the semi-finals. Four years after Måneskin's victory, Eurovision's rock revival continues apace. Italy are back at it again, thanks to Lucio Corsi – think David Bowie as Pierrot – and his glam rock ballad Volevo Essere Un Duro (I wanted to be tough). A delicate anthem for people who feel they don't fit in, it recalls how Lucio was bullied as a kid, and how he's grown to embrace his fragility. At one point, he sings: ""Instead of a star, [I'm] just a sneeze."" It's a timeless bit of songwriting that pulls off that crucial Eurovision trick of sounding new and familiar all at once. Portuguese indie band Napa also have a 70s vibe, channelling Paul McCartney's Wings on the soft rock tear-jerker Deslocado (out of place). It's another song about migration, written after the band were forced to relocate from Madeira to the Portuguese mainland due to the economic crisis. ""Even though we've been here for a few years we always have that desire to go back, and that anguish of saying goodbye to family,"" said singer Guilherme Gomes. Last but not least are Ukraine's Ziferblat, who continue the country's astonishing run of high-quality entries in the midst of a war with Russia. Their song, Bird Of Pray, is an unexpected mix of 70s new wave band Cars, birdsong and the guitar riff from Rachel Stevens' Sweet Dreams My LA Ex – while the lyrics are full of hope for a peaceful reunion with their loved ones. It's better than that makes it sound. Where would Eurovision be without a raven-haired woman bellowing into a wind machine set to ""hurricane""? Israel has strong form in this category, and sets the bar again with New Day Will Rise, a melancholy piano ballad sung in a mixture of English, French and Hebrew. The song's performed by Yuval Raphael, a 24-year-old who narrowly escaped with her life at the 2023 Nova music festival, where an attack by Hamas claimed the lives of 378 people and triggered Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza. It's hard not to interpret her lyrics as a response to those events – ""everyone cries, don't cry alone"". As a result, her participation hasn't received the same level of criticism as Eden Golan, who represented Israel last year. That can't be said for Georgia's contestant, Mariam Shengelia, who has been booed during pre-Eurovision appearances for her alleged support of the country's authoritarian, pro-Russian, anti-LGBT ruling party, Georgian Dream. Shengelia has denied the accusations, pointing out that her song – a stirring, quasi-militaristic ballad called Freedom – is about ""freedom of choice, freedom to love, freedom to live as you want to live"". ""No amount of manufactured hate will change that,"" she told the Eurovision fan site Wiwibloggs. Montenegro's Nina Žižić tackles domestic abuse in Dobrodošli, a brooding and refined orchestral ballad. The singer, who previously entered Eurovision in 2013 with the cyborg pop oddity Igranka, delivers her lyrics with passion and sincerity, but somehow the song never quite takes off. Last but not least, we have defending champions Switzerland, represented by 24-year-old Zoë Më, who describes herself as a ""little fairy"". Appropriately enough, her self-penned song, Voyage is delicate as a fairy's wings, fluttering with a soft-spoken plea to treat each other with kindness. Automatically qualifying for the final, it's a welcome oasis of calm amidst the steamy sauna sessions, moody goth haircuts and thrusting innuendo. But that's Eurovision for you. All human life is here. See you in Basel! The contest, which is hosted by the EBU, will begin on 13 May in Basel, Switzerland with the final on 17 May. They are among 400 artists appealing to Sir Keir Starmer, saying creative industries are threatened. One of the most controversial entries in the Eurovision song contest is Espresso Macchiato by Estonia's Tommy Cash. It mocks Italian stereotypes, and there have been calls to ban it. McFly star Harry Judd says seeing the crowd chanting Joel's name was ""so cool"". Trading Standards is warning fans after the BBC finds scammers operating an hour after a pre-sale.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2j45d5zeo,"Earlier this year, Deborah Grushkin, an enthusiastic online shopper from New Jersey, ""freaked out"". US President Donald Trump had signed an order to stop allowing packages from China worth less than $800 (£601) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures. It was a move, backed by traditional retailers, that had been discussed in Washington for years amid an explosion of packages slipping into the US under the limit. Many countries, including the UK, are considering similar measures, spurred in part by the rapid ascent of Shein and Temu. But in the US, Trump's decision to end the carve-out while ordering a blitz of new trade tariffs, including import taxes of at least 145% on goods from China, has delivered a one-two punch that has left businesses and shoppers reeling. US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the system, are warning the changes could spark failures of smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah brace for price hikes and shortages. With the 2 May deadline bearing down, the 36-year-old last month rushed in some $400 worth of items from Shein - including stickers, T-shirts, sweatshirts, Mother's Days gifts and 20 tubes of liquid eyeliner. ""I felt like maybe it was my last sort of hurrah,"" she says. Use of rules known as ""de minimis"", which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections and other regulatory requirements, has surged over the last decade. Take-up accelerated during Trump's first term in office, when he raised tariffs on many Chinese goods. By 2023, such shipments represented more than 7% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.4 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 3.7 million a day. Advocates of the carve-out, which include shipping firms, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for customers. Those in favour of change, a group that includes lawmakers from both parties, say businesses are abusing rules intended to ease gifts between family and friends, and the rise has made it easier to slip products that are illegal, counterfeit or violate safety standards and other rules into the country. Trump recently called de minimis a ""scam"", brushing off concerns about higher costs. ""Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,"" he said. However, polls suggest concerns about his economic policies are rising as the changes start to hit home. Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has nervously been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently cancelling an order for curtains after seeing the price more than triple. Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had more than doubled. ""I don't know who pays the tariff except the customer,"" she says. ""Everywhere is selling cheap stuff from China so I actually prefer being able to order directly."" When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be handled by ""locally based sellers"", with orders fulfilled from within the US. Even without the latest tariffs, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that ending de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in new costs, which they found would be disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households. ""It does kind of feel like the end of an era,"" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as an electric can opener and kitchen cabinet organisers. She says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like a ""money grab"" by the government to benefit big, entrenched American retailers like Amazon and Walmart that sell similar products - but at a bigger mark-up. ""I don't think it's right or fair that little treats should be [restricted] to people who are richer. ""It just would be a real bummer if everyone who was under a certain household income threshold was just no longer able to afford anything for themselves."" As with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift. The president was already forced to suspend the policy once before, as packages began piling up at the border. Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports ending de minimis for consumer safety reasons, says the end of the exemption is significant ""on paper"", but she fears the administration is taking steps that will weaken its implementation. She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariffs could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements. ""Practically, because all of this stuff can come though informal entry, it's going to be extremely hard to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much more than before the change happened,"" she says. Customs and Border Protection deny the move will undermine enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply more information than before. Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes seriously. Both Shein and Temu last month warned customers that prices would rise, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to protect its low prices. Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are struggling - and may not survive. ""If the tariffs weren't in place, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine,"" says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing. ""But paired with the other tariffs, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes an insurmountable shift."" In a letter to the government last month, men's clothing company Indochino, known for its custom suits made-to-order in China, warned that ending de minimis posed a ""significant threat to the viability"" of its business and other mid-size American firms like it. Steven Borelli is the chief executive of the athleisure clothing firm CUTS, which manufactures outside the US, shipping products to a warehouse in Mexico, from where packages are mailed to customers in the US. His firm has been pushing to reduce its reliance on China, halting orders in the country months ago. Still, he says he is now considering price increases and job cuts. He says his business has room to manoeuvre, since it caters to higher income customers, but he expects ""thousands"" of other brands to die without changes to the situation. ""We want more time,"" he says. ""The speed at which everything is happening is too fast for businesses to adjust."" The White House is ""actively looking at"" suspending the legal right to challenge detention. Pope Leo XIV has expressed support for immigrants and criticism of JD Vance. Donald Trump's supporters aren't happy. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was among Democratic officials seeking to enter the facility. Her arrest followed the White House's crackdown on what it has classified as antisemitism on US campuses. Economic pressures are forcing Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to seek an off-ramp in the trade war. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.
